    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the ground beef until fully cooked. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic to the skillet with the cooked beef. Sauté until the onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with a beaten egg. Mix well to create the cheese filling.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a deep baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles on top.</li>
        <li>Add half of the ricotta cheese mixture, spreading it evenly over the noodles. Sprinkle a portion of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a generous layer of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for an additional 15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and serve this delectable homemade lasagna to delight your taste buds.</li>
